# JWS Signatures

JSON Web Signatures (JWS) provide a mechanism for digitally signing data, ensuring both the integrity and authenticity of the data. This article delves into the concepts behind JWS, how to create and verify signatures using the **jose-swift** library, and practical examples to help you get started.

## What is a JWS?

A JSON Web Signature (JWS) is a compact, URL-safe token format that represents signed content using JSON data structures. It is used to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the message by applying a digital signature or MAC (Message Authentication Code).

## Supported Algorithms

The **jose-swift** library supports a wide range of cryptographic algorithms for signing and verifying JSON Web Signatures (JWS). The supported algorithms are:

- **RS256**: RSA Signature with SHA-256
- **RS384**: RSA Signature with SHA-384
- **RS512**: RSA Signature with SHA-512
- **HS256**: HMAC with SHA-256
- **HS384**: HMAC with SHA-384
- **HS512**: HMAC with SHA-512
- **ES256**: ECDSA using P-256 and SHA-256
- **ES384**: ECDSA using P-384 and SHA-384
- **ES512**: ECDSA using P-521 and SHA-512
- **ES256K**: ECDSA using secp256k1 and SHA-256
- **PS256**: RSA PSS with SHA-256
- **PS384**: RSA PSS with SHA-384
- **PS512**: RSA PSS with SHA-512
- **EdDSA**: EdDSA using Ed25519 ([RFC 8037](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8037))

These algorithms provide flexibility in choosing the level of security and compatibility with different cryptographic standards. You can specify the algorithm to be used in the `alg` field of the JWS header when creating or verifying a JWS.

## Structure of a JWS

A JWS is composed of three parts, separated by dots (`.`):

1. **Header**
2. **Payload**
3. **Signature**

### 1. Header

The JWS header contains metadata about the signature, including the algorithm used for signing and the type of token. The header is Base64Url encoded.

Example:

```
{
    “alg”: “HS256”,
    “typ”: “JWT”
}
```

### 2. Payload

The payload is the data being protected, typically containing the claims. The payload is also Base64Url encoded.

Example:

```
{
    “sub”: “1234567890”,
    “name”: “John Doe”,
    “admin”: true
}
```

### 3. Signature

The signature is created by signing the Base64Url encoded header and payload using the specified algorithm and a secret or private key.

For example, with HMAC SHA256, the signature is created as follows:

```
HMACSHA256(base64UrlEncode(header) + “.” + base64UrlEncode(payload),secret)
```

## Creating a JWS

Using the **jose-swift** library, creating a JWS is straightforward. Here’s an example of how to create a signed JWT, which is a specific type of JWS:

```swift
let key = P256.Signing.PrivateKey()
let payload = “Hello, World!”.data(using: .utf8)!

let header = DefaultJWSHeaderImpl(algorithm: .ES256)
let jws = try JWS(
    payload: payload,
    protectedHeader: header,
    key: key
)

print(“JWS: (jws.compactSerialization)”)
```

In this example, the `JWS` initializer generates a signed JWS using the ES256 algorithm and the provided private key.

## Verifying a JWS

To verify a JWS, you need to use the public key corresponding to the private key that was used to sign the token. Here’s an example:

```swift
let jwsString = “your.jws.token.here”
let publicKey = P256.Signing.PublicKey()
let jws = try JWS(jwsString: jwsString)

let isValid = try jws.verify(key: publicKey)
print(“Signature is valid: (isValid)”)
```

In this example, the `verify` method verifies the JWS using the public key.

## Using Custom Headers

You can include custom headers in your JWS to add additional metadata. Here’s an example:

```swift
let key = secp256k1.Signing.PrivateKey()
let payload = “Hello, World!”.data(using: .utf8)!

var header = DefaultJWSHeaderImpl(algorithm: .ES256K)
header.keyID = “key-id”

let jws = try JWS(
    payload: payload,
    protectedHeader: header,
    key: key
)

print(“JWS: (jws.compactSerialization)”)
```

In this example, the `kid` (key ID) field is added to the header to specify which key was used for signing.

## Nested JWS

A Nested JWS is a JWS that is signed and then signed again. This provides an additional layer of security by ensuring both the integrity and authenticity of the message. Here’s how to create a nested JWS:

```swift
let nestedKey = RSA(keySize: 1228)
let nestedPayload = “Nested payload”.data(using: .utf8)!

let nestedHeader = DefaultJWSHeaderImpl(algorithm: .RS512)
let nestedJws = try JWS(
    payload: nestedPayload,
    protectedHeader: nestedHeader,
    key: nestedKey
)

let outerKey = P521.Signing.PrivateKey()
let outerHeader = DefaultJWSHeaderImpl(algorithm: .ES512, contentType: “JWT”)
let outerJws = try JWS(
    payload: JSONEncoder().encode(nestedJws.compactSerialization),
    protectedHeader: outerHeader,
    key: outerKey
)

print(“Nested JWS: (outerJws.compactSerialization)”)
```

## Conclusion

JSON Web Signatures (JWS) are a powerful way to ensure the integrity and authenticity of your data. The **jose-swift** library provides robust support for creating and verifying JWS, including custom headers and nested tokens.
