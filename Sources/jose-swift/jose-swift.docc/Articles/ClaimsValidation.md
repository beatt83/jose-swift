# Claims Validation

Claims validation is a crucial aspect of JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) to ensure that the token is valid, trustworthy, and has not been tampered with. This article explains the concepts behind claims validation, how to perform claims validation using the **jose-swift** library, and practical examples to get you started.

## What are Claims?

Claims are pieces of information asserted about a subject. They are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional metadata. Claims are used to pass information between two parties.

### Common Types of Claims

1. **Registered Claims**: Predefined claims that are recommended to provide a set of useful, interoperable claims. Examples include `iss` (issuer), `exp` (expiration time), `sub` (subject), `aud` (audience), `nbf` (not before), and `iat` (issued at).

2. **Public Claims**: Custom claims that can be defined by those using JWTs. These claims should be collision-resistant, typically using namespaces like `http://example.com/claim`.

3. **Private Claims**: Custom claims agreed upon by parties that use JWTs and are not registered or public.

## Validating Claims

Claims validation involves verifying that the claims contained in a JWT meet certain criteria. This typically includes checking the token's expiration time, ensuring the token is not used before a certain time, and verifying that the token was issued by a trusted source.

## Conclusion

Claims validation is a fundamental part of ensuring the integrity and trustworthiness of JSON Web Tokens. By validating claims, you can ensure that tokens are used appropriately and have not been tampered with. The jose-swift library provides robust tools for performing standard and custom claims validation, enabling you to build secure applications.
